# Animation engine mechanics

These are the supplied kit's style defaults, not universal filmmaking rules. The user's approved creative decisions take precedence. Use production.md for the repaired commands.

## Shot plan (`work/PLAN.md` before code)
Make one row per shot: frames, words, setting, light, camera move, characters/poses/expressions, effects and SFX cue.
- Frame 0 is already the hook image.
- Usually one shot per phrase. Merge tiny phrases into the next shot.
- Illustrate every sentence literally. Props carry the jokes.
- Vary shot sizes: hook MCU → wide reveal → two-shot → insert close-up on the key object → reaction close-up → environment move for the payoff.
- Use light for beats: day for normal, golden for decline or drama, night-blue for explanation. A time jump gets a 6-frame white flash.
- The twist line gets a sting (music stops, low hit, push-in with roll). The last shot's physical payoff lands on the final word.

## World (`web/main.js`)
Keep the engine sections: toon materials, ink contract, `add`/`tbox`, sky, lights, cards, render targets/post, `applyLight`, `drawActors`, `swapForNd`, `renderFrame`. Replace the example world between `// ---------- world ----------` and `// ---------- cards ----------`, plus the story parts of `worldState()`.
- Build from primitives with painted canvas textures (`paint.js`: planks, beams, rotten wood, stone, moss/ivy, grass, dirt, plaster, roof tiles, marble, banners, carved text). Write new painters in the same flat-with-dark-seams style.
- Use `tbox` for constant texel density, a 2-step toon gradient, and fog = horizon colour.
- Background: hills (half-buried spheres), mountains (cones + snow caps), cypress/pine trees, distant houses, painted cloud billboards.
- Set pieces (collapses, falls, doors) are pivoted groups driven by 0..1 progress from `worldAt(f)`, with eased and staggered parts.
- Curved diegetic text uses planar UVs. Check it isn't mirrored.

## Cast (`web/roman.js` → `web/toon.js`)
- `romanFront(p, outfitKey, opts)` draws on a 600x1000 design canvas with soles at y=975. The card is 2.25 m tall, so 1 unit = 0.00225 m.
- Add outfits to `OUTFITS` (tunic/cape/armor/helmet/hair/cap/beard/apron/dress/toga) and new headgear and props in the same style.
- Arm poses: hang, spear, point, up, wave, hip, belly, temple (+swirl), lift, reach (+lift), cheek, shield, cross, thumb.
- Expressions: the toon.ts FACE set plus snore, stubborn, squint. Extend FACE for more.
- Rebuild after edits with `node -e "const fs=require('fs');fs.writeFileSync('web/toon.js',fs.readFileSync('web/toonbase.js','utf8')+'\n'+fs.readFileSync('web/roman.js','utf8'))"`. Render a character test sheet before using new designs.
- Billboards turn on yaw only, get a contact blob and an alpha-tested shadow, and are never inked by the world pass.
- Build card keys from `q()`-rounded values (so the canvas redraws only on visible change).
- A detached part (e.g. a lifted helmet) is its own card, aligned with `headCenter(seed)`: y = DECK + (partY − hc) × 0.00225.

## Motion: smooth and alive (`web/motion.js`)
- **Cameras**: `camFromKeys(keys, f, {kicks})`. Use smootherstep glides (18-45 f), `easeOut` for reveals and whips, and `path` via-points (Catmull-Rom) for curved moves. Every hold creeps and nothing is static for 4+ frames. Use 3-5° rolls on drama and 7-frame flip-shakes on impacts.
- **Continuity**: prefer continuous moves (pull back from a close-up into the wide, rack focus, crane through the deck, push into an object). Hard cut only on place or time jumps, with a flash.
- **Characters never freeze**: apply `idle(f, seed)` to every card, `blinkAt` blinks, and head bobs on stressed words.
- **Actions**: anticipation → `back` overshoot → `spring` settle. A stamp is a 2-frame dip + dust puff + kick. Laughs are an alternating tilt + bob.
- **Secondary motion**: banner cloth waves, leaves/dust/drips/Zzz effect cards, flowing water. Something always moves.
- **Walks**: `walk()` gives distance + step phase. Feet planted, bob 3-7 %.
- **Lens**: DOF on close-ups and mediums (cInf 8-14 px), focus on the eyes. Wides are sharp. Racks take ~14 f.

## Look check (before the full render)
Render stills at each shot's middle plus the transitions and key actions: `node render.mjs stills/a "5,40,..."` then `<python> sheet.py stills/a stills/sheet_a.jpg`. Look at the sheet and fix these traps:
- **Narrow vertical frame**: horizontal half-width = d·tan(hfov/2), with hfov = 2·atan(tan(vfov/2)·0.5625). At 4 m and fov 40 that is ±0.8 m, so stage characters in depth.
- Railings or posts across faces (camera inside the rail or ~2.5 m up). The camera path through houses, roofs or bushes. Foreground props under ~2 m away. The hero hidden behind a pillar.
- Mirrored text. A detached-part card offset the wrong way.
- Extrude material groups: 0 = caps, 1 = sides+top.
- Missing ink: debug the edge-only output. Ink radius ~2.5 px at 1080. The sky counts as far depth, not a card.
Send the sheet to the user with a one-line shot summary, then start the full render.


## Engine gotchas (kept in the kit; keep them if rebuilding)
- `#include <fog_vertex>` / `<fog_fragment>` go on their own lines.
- The final pass writes `linearToOutputTexel(...)` (render targets are linear HalfFloat).
- The normal+depth pass swaps materials per mesh: world → normal/depth, cards → alpha-tested mask (rgb 0, a = depth), blobs/clouds/sky hidden, water → flat normal. Fog and shadows are off during it.
- Ink goes on the near side of depth jumps only. Creases come from the normal dot. Card neighbours are skipped. Ink fades at ~140-520 m.
- DOF: 48 taps with a per-sample CoC test (no foreground bleed).
- The sun comes from az/el per light preset. The shadow camera is centred on each shot's action.

## Architecture (reference for editing the kit)
- `web/index.html` loads `main.js` (ES module) over a local HTTP server.
- `main.js`: renderer, toon materials, world, cards (1200x2000 CanvasTexture planes, origin at soles), passes colour (RT samples 4) → normal/depth → ink+grade (saturation, gain/lift, vignette, flash) → DOF to screen. It exposes `window.renderFrame(f)` and `window.ready`.
- `story.js` exports SHOTS, `shotAt`, `camAt`, `dofAt`, LIGHTS/`lightFor`, `worldAt`, `actorsAt(f, T)`, `fxAt(f, T)`. All are pure functions of the frame.
- `render.mjs`: Playwright → `renderFrame(f)` → `toDataURL('image/jpeg', .95)` → `frames/f0000.jpg`.
- `mix.py`: constant-gain gated-RMS level lock (music at 25 % of voice; SFX at or below 25 %, peaks capped at 35 % of narration peak; user overrides supported). `finish.py`: shared linear gain with peak headroom, encoding and QA; no dynamic limiter or ducking.
- Characters: the Pen API from mromidev/claude-animated-shorts `templates/bridge/toon.ts`, extended in the same module scope by the cast file.
